## Goals

Machine learning is a force multiplier for engineers such as myself. However, the field is 
still immature when it comes to traditional industrial applications. It tries to make the
problems fit the mould of a static classification problem, which is fine for a
subset of problems - but not for the vast majority.

The solution is simple. We can not have the data scientist calling the shots when it comes to 
applying machine learning in the domain of the engineer. It is time to adopt the techniques and
turn them into new tools for the engineering toolbelt.

My goal is to help build these new tools.
